# Linear Fox API V1 [Test] Documentation

Welcome to our API! We're glad you're here. Our API allows you to access our platform and retrieve data in a programmatic way. In this documentation, you'll find information on how to authenticate your requests, rate limits, and endpoints available for you to use.

## Authentication

Some endpoints require authentication you'll need to provide a bearer token in the headers of your requests. The bearer token is a string that you can generate from your account dashboard on our website. Once you have the token, you'll need to include it in the headers of your requests like this:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE & OAuth 2.0 or Using API Key
```

## Rate Limits
To ensure fair usage of our API, we've implemented rate limits on all endpoints. The current rate limit is 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.


## Endpoints
Endpoints are the URLs you'll use to access our API. Each endpoint has a specific purpose and returns a specific type of data. The endpoints are grouped into categories based on the type of data they return. You can find more information about each endpoint in the sections below.
    - GET ```$API_URL/v1/user/data/$USER_ID``` Retrieve a specific user by ID
    - POST ```$API_URL/v1/auth/check``` Check if a user is authenticated "Bearer Token Required"
    - PUT & DELETE ```$API_URL/v1/account/editbackground/``` Edit the background of a user "Bearer Token Required"

## Types of API Parameters
    - Query string parameters ```$API_URL/v1/user/data/$USER_ID?name=LinearFox&age=20```
    - Path parameters ```$API_URL/v1/user/data/$USER_ID```
    - Body parameters ```$API_URL/v1/auth/check```

    ### Query Parameters
    These are the most common type of parameters. You’ve probably seen them before on your browser’s address bar, even outside the context of APIs. You can find them in the query string of the endpoint, after the ?.

    ### Path Parameters
    Path parameters are used to identify a specific resource. For example, in the endpoint /users/:id, the id is a path parameter. You can find them in the path of the endpoint, after the /.

    ### Body Parameters
    Body parameters are used to send data to the API. For example, when you create a new user, you send the user’s name and email in the request body. You can find them in the body of the request.
