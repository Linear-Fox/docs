# Content Moderation

Linear Fox provides a platform for content moderation via Computer Vision. It allows you to automatically detect and classify inappropriate content.

Using this endpoint, you need to create a Linear Fox account and generate an `API_key`, or use a generated authentication bearer token. See: [V1_API](/V1_API/auth).

# Features
 
- Identify Objects: Detect inappropriate objects like explosives, drugs, and weapons. (Not available yet)
- Detect Explicit Content: Detect unrealistic or unknowingly inappropriate images.

# User Privacy Policy
We respect user privacy concerns, hence we don't store or pass on any of the images. However, `date_created`, `filename`, `results` and `user_id` are the only parameters that are stored for learning how the model can be improved upon.
