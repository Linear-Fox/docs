## API Reference

Linear Fox API is a RESTful API that allows you to access all of our services and products. The API is organized around REST and has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

> **Note:** Our base & sandbox URL is
```https://api.linearfox.com ? https://sandbox.linearfox.com```

We recommend you to use our main API URL for production and our sandbox URL for testing and development. Sandbox is includes new features and services that are not yet available in the main API so its extremly unstable than the main API.
