# Authentication
Most API requests require authentication. After you create account, you can create a API-Key or grab the access token from the browser console log "cookies" of your account. Set this token in the Authorization header of requests to the API for protected endpoints.

This API enables you to manage all aspects of your Linear Fox account and services.
Authentication methods
    - ```API Key``` - Create and manage access tokens for your account.
    - ```OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token``` - Authenticate with a bearer token.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
