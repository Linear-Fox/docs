# Linear Fox API Documentation

## What is Linear Fox AI?
Linear Fox AI is a set of APIs made for researching and developing AI. This API includes our trained models and a third party ai models. Pre-trained text models, vision models, audio models, and also multimodal models! like the PaLM lang model or yolov5 vision model.

## How to use AI APIs?
To use the Linear Fox AI APIs, you must have an account. Open an account [here](https://account.linearfox.com/auth/signup). If you already have an account, create an API Key in the security "settings" or use your account's cookie token to access the API.

### Simple linearfoxai-python library [git link](https://github.com/Linear-Fox/linearfoxai-python) [pypi link](https://pypi.org/project/linearfoxai/)

This library is still in development, we in very early stages of development. This just a simple code.

```python
from linearfoxai import LinearFoxAI
    
class TestAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.text_model = "vulpestra" # Use GPT, PaLM, Vicuna or our vulpestra trained models
        self.image_model = "yolov5"
        self.audio_model = "wav2vec2"
        self.ai = LinearFoxAI("YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    def test_ai(self):
        text = "Hello, my name is fargo, how are you?"
        image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
        audio_path = "path/to/audio.wav"
        
        text_result = self.ai.text(self.text_model, text)
        image_result = self.ai.image(self.image_model, image_path)
        audio_result = self.ai.audio(self.audio_model, audio_path)
        
        print("Text Result: ", text_result)
        print("Image Result: ", image_result)
        print("Audio Result: ", audio_result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TestAI().test_ai()
```

By this library, you will call eaiser the APIs and its open source, you can contribute to it. We will add more features in the future.
